# AI Plant Identifier - Project Planning Document

## Project Overview
The AI Plant Identifier is a web-based application that allows users to upload plant images and receive detailed information about the plant using AI-powered image analysis. The application provides scientific and common names, plant characteristics, and care requirements in a user-friendly format.

## Project Scope
- Image upload functionality with drag-and-drop support
- AI-powered plant analysis using OpenAI's Vision API
- Detailed plant information output including:
  - Scientific and common names
  - Identification confidence
  - Plant description
  - Physical characteristics
  - Care requirements
- Responsive web interface
- Error handling and user feedback
- Markdown-formatted results display

## Technical Architecture
The application follows a client-side architecture with the following components:

### Core Components
1. **App (Root)**: Main application container and state management
2. **DropZone**: Handles image file uploads
3. **ImagePreview**: Displays uploaded image
4. **PlantDetails**: Renders analysis results in markdown format

### Data Flow
1. User uploads image â†’ DropZone component
2. Image preview displayed
3. Analysis request sent to OpenAI API
4. Results processed and displayed in markdown format

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - react-dropzone: File upload handling
  - react-markdown: Markdown rendering
  - openai: API integration
  - lucide-react: UI icons
- **Development Tools**:
  - ESLint
  - TypeScript
  - PostCSS
  - Autoprefixer

## Security Considerations
1. **API Key Management**:
   - OpenAI API key stored in environment variables
   - Client-side validation of API key presence
   - Warning: Current implementation exposes API key to browser

2. **File Upload Security**:
   - Client-side file validation
   - Size and type restrictions needed
   - Secure handling of file data

3. **Improvements Needed**:
   - Move API calls to backend service
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add user authentication
   - Add input sanitization

## Performance Goals
1. **Response Time**:
   - Image upload: < 1 second
   - Analysis results: < 5 seconds
   - UI interactions: < 100ms

2. **Resource Usage**:
   - Optimize image processing
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Minimize bundle size

3. **Scalability**:
   - Handle multiple concurrent users
   - Implement caching for repeated queries
   - Optimize API usage

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Current Setup**:
   - Vite-based build process
   - Static file hosting capable
   - Environment variable configuration

2. **Recommended Deployment**:
   - Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel)
   - CDN for asset delivery
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Automated CI/CD pipeline

## Future Extensions
1. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Plant disease detection
   - Multiple image analysis
   - Save analysis history
   - Offline capability
   - Plant care reminders

2. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Backend service implementation
   - User authentication
   - Result caching
   - Progressive Web App (PWA)
   - Mobile app version

3. **Integration Opportunities**:
   - Plant care tracking
   - Community features
   - E-commerce integration
   - Garden planning tools
   - Weather integration

4. **AI Enhancements**:
   - Local model support
   - Multiple AI provider support
   - Custom model training
   - Real-time analysis
